# STOMP Over WebSocket Chat Example

This is an example "chat" application using STOMP (Simple Text-Oriented Messaging Protocol) over
WebSockets. It uses Spring Boot on the back-end and Vue.js on the front-end, structured as a
multi-module Maven project, so you can build and deploy it as a single artifact. 

### Back-end

* Spring Boot 2.3.2
* Dependencies managed and built using Maven

### Front-end

* Vue
* Dependencies managed via npm
